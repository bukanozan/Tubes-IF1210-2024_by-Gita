back-up file 'TUBES_DASPRO" for personal use

Hello! This is my personal repository for backing up and testing for 1000 times of debugging. The final one will be uploaded soon. Or maybe it would be more "final" than the original one :D more likely i added some user-interfaces for clear terminal, ASCII art, table, etc. 

HOW TO USE:
1. Download 'zip' of this repository (click code > download zip files)
2. Make sure that the 'database' and the sourcecodes are in the same folder
3. Open folder
4. Run 'main.py' by type "py main.py database" on terminal
5. Done
